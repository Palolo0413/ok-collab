## OkCollab

# UserList (Browse feature)
The UserList component maps the users into a visually attractive layout of large thumbnails, displaying their photo, name, city, and list of skills.

# UserProfile
The UserProfile component displays the user's information -- their photo, name, and city, along with blurbs about who they are, what genres they like, and what they're looking for out of a potential collaboration. It also features embedded Youtube videos that the user uploaded.

# Navigation Bar
The navigation bar features links for browse, message inbox, and the user's own profile. It also features a photo and the name of the current logged-in user. When viewed by a mobile device or small browser window, it changes to a more streamlined view which can be expanded.

# Recommendation Engine for Similar Users (basic)
Currently, the Recommendations component simply recommends three random other users who are not the currently selected user. Eventually, this could be built out to use logic around skills and words mentioned in the person's profile to find people with similar skills and genre preferences.

# Messaging (under construction)
The messaging feature is currently under construction. When a user clicks the "Message" button on a profile, a modal appears and a message can be entered, but upon submitting it, nothing happens with the data. The Messages tab does not yet display the user's messages, because the messages are not yet being stored.

# Mobile Responsivity
OkCollab changes its layout to suit the size of the browser window, with sidebars moving and changing and content becoming vertically stacked as needed.

# Next features to work on:
* Messages
* Signup
* Editable fields on user's own profile
